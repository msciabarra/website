Afther just 8 months of running our project, we already have 12 contributors to the Nuvolaris project and are moving to our third milestone. Let's talk about this.

So I have been asked: "How the hell did you do it? I've been running an open-source project for years, but nobody ever came to help me...". Here are my thoughts on the matter.

The first thing that comes to mind is that if you want help in an open source project, you must first make sure that helping you would be interesting and useful for those who collaborate!

In fact, what a contributor to an open-source project looks for is an opportunity to learn something. But since no one is born knowing everything, if you already have to know the things you "want" to learn so that you can collaborate on the project, you are not going anywhere. Nobody will ever help you!

Keeping this in mind, when we started Nuvolaris, we organized it in a way that was easily accessible to external collaborators. We took great care of the documentation and communication with the contributors.

We didn't focus a lot on building a site. Our focus was on making a clear GitHub repository, where we documented all the steps needed to collaborate.

We then activated all the channels to contact us, i.e., Discord as the Forum and GitHub Issues. After that, we started community calls on Zoom, recorded the calls and posted them on our YouTube channel, which helped us share information with our audience and train them.

From a technical point of view, despite project complexity, everything has been divided into relatively simple, homogeneous, mono-technological sub-projects that can be approached individually without having to "know it all".

There are parts of CLI coding where you just need to know the basic Go. There are parts where you need to develop a front-end, and all you need is to be knowledgeable in Javascript (with our framework, Svelte).

The most complicated project, the operator, which requires both Python and Kubernetes, has been split into tasks that require only Kubernetes and the ones that require only Python.

So now, if anyone asks why we are so against full-stack, we've given you a practical demonstration of what we mean. Every project can be managed as a collection of components that require in-depth expertise of only a single area.

When you're incapable of organizing projects and managing them, and everything is a tangled mixture of complexities with no clear boundaries, you look for full-stacks. Full-stacks do it all and navigate through the chaos (or at least that's what you want to believe).

Since we already have several contributors, none of them professing to "know it all", but rather collaborating to learn something, the project is moving forward thanks to their help.
