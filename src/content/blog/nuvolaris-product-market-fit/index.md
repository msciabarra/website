The mission of a startup is to find its product-market fit. And what is important to realize is that the actual market for your product can be very different from what you initially think.

After 10 months of running Nuvolaris, we had to accept the idea that it does not look very attractive to single developers, freelancers, or small businesses.

The reason is very easy to grasp: individuals are generally interested in getting the job done and making a living in the short term.

Features like multi-cloud portability and easiness of development are not important for a single developer. But they are for the chief of large enterprises.

Indeed, we got our first set of customers and adopters. Add all of them are huge! Large companies, all are interested in the strategic proposition more than in the short-term advantage.

This is a great value for a startup. Honestly speaking, I was looking to get hundreds or thousands of small adopters while just a bunch of big companies is enough to make us profitable. We are an enterprise company and this is our destiny.

What is interesting is we did not look for them. All of them knocked on our door and told us the Nuvolaris idea was interesting and we started collaborating to run their systems.

Today I found on Hacker News that Steve Jobs has been secretly running OSX on Intel at the time when Apple ran on PowerPC. Not surprisingly they did now the same move for ARM.

Portability is a great value but it is generally better understood at the CEO, CIO, and CTO levels. From the point of view of a single developer, it does not matter. But for the C-level, luckily for us, it does. A lot.
