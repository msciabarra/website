			Everything started when Michele Sciabarr√†, our CEO, was looking for an open source product
			implementing some of the features of Amazon Lambda for Kubernetes, and stumbled upon Apache
			OpenWhisk. After trying it out on a Windows machine, he found a small issue and quickly fixed
			it.<br /><br /> But instead of throwing it away, he contributed the fix to the project. The
			fix was quickly approved, which was a motivation to contribute more to the project. <br /><br
			/>
			Michele soon joined the project as an active contributor, by first implementing a runtime for the
			Go programming language, that turned out to be very fast. It was later used as a basis for the
			PHP runtime, following with Python, Ruby, Java, Rust and Deno runtimes. <br /><br />
			Michele later joined the OpenWhisk project in the Project Management Committee. <br /><br />

			Some of the founders of the OpenWhisk project left IBM to create a startup, Nimbella, focused
			on moving forward the OpenWhisk project and building "a beautiful cloud". <br /><br />
			Michele joined Nimbella six months after its foundation as one of the first employees, and worked
			at the beginning as a core platform developer, then moved into business managing operations in
			Europe, as Nimbella Europe Manager. <br /><br />

			Nimbella was acquired by Digital Ocean in September 2021, when Michele became Senior Developer
			Advocate.<br />
			But the business operations started in Europe made it clear that there exists a market for business
			operations which Nimbella as a division of Digital Ocean can not cover.<br />
			Michele decided to leave and founded Nuvolaris. <br /><br />

			So now we are in this together at Nuvolaris, the company whose name comes from italian word
			for cloud (nuvola).
