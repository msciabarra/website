				Everything started when Michele Sciabarr√†, our CEO, was looking for an open source product
				implementing some of the features of Amazon Lambda for Kubernetes, and stumbled upon Apache
				OpenWhisk. After trying it out on a Windows machine, he found a small issue and quickly
				fixed it. <br /> <br />

				But instead of throwing it away, he contributed the fix to the project. The fix was quickly
				approved, which was a motivation to contribute more to the project. <br /> <br />

				Michele soon joined the project as an active contributor, by first implementing a runtime
				for the Go programming language, that turned out to be very fast. It was later used as a
				basis for the PHP runtime, following with Python, Ruby, Java, Rust and Deno runtimes. <br />
				<br />

				Michele later joined the OpenWhisk project in the Project Management Committee. <br />
				<br />

				Some of the founders of the OpenWhisk project left IBM to create a startup, Nimbella,
				focused on moving forward the OpenWhisk project and building "a beautiful cloud". <br />
				<br />

				Michele joined Nimbella six months after its foundation as one of the first employees, and
				worked at the beginning as a core platform developer, then moved into business managing
				operations in Europe, as Nimbella Europe Manager. <br /> <br />

				Nimbella was acquired by Digital Ocean in September 2021, when Michele became Senior
				Developer Advocate. But the business operations started in Europe made it clear that there
				exists a market for business operations which Nimbella as a division of Digital Ocean can
				not cover. Michele decided to leave and founded Nuvolaris. <br /> <br />

				So now we are in this together at Nuvolaris, the company whose name comes from italian word
				for cloud (nuvola).
