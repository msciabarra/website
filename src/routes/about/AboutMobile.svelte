		Everything started when Michele Sciabarr√†, our CEO, was looking for an open source product
		implementing some of the features of Amazon Lambda for Kubernetes, and stumbled upon Apache
		OpenWhisk. After trying it out on a Windows machine, he found a small issue and quickly fixed
		it. <br /> <br />

		But instead of throwing it away, he contributed the fix to the project. The fix was quickly
		approved, which was a motivation to contribute more to the project. <br /> <br />

		Michele soon joined the project as an active contributor, by first implementing a runtime for
		the Go programming language, that turned out to be very fast. It was later used as a basis for
		the PHP runtime, following with Python, Ruby, Java, Rust and Deno runtimes. <br /> <br />

		Michele later joined the OpenWhisk project in the Project Management Committee. <br /> <br />

		Some of the founders of the OpenWhisk project left IBM to create a startup, Nimbella, focused on
		moving forward the OpenWhisk project and building "a beautiful cloud". <br /> <br />

		Michele joined Nimbella six months after its foundation as one of the first employees, and
		worked at the beginning as a core platform developer, then moved into business managing
		operations in Europe, as Nimbella Europe Manager. <br /> <br />

		Nimbella was acquired by Digital Ocean in September 2021, when Michele became Senior Developer
		Advocate. But the business operations started in Europe made it clear that there exists a market
		for business operations which Nimbella as a division of Digital Ocean can not cover. Michele
		decided to leave and founded Nuvolaris. <br /> <br />

		So now we are in this together at Nuvolaris, the company whose name comes from italian word for
		cloud (nuvola).
